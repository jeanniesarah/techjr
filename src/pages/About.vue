      h1 Who the heck are these guys?
      p Lee Warrick and Edwin Otero are Orlando-based web developers that are looking to give back to the tech community.
      p Becoming a developer isn't easy, and we don't mean just learning the technology.
      p There's a wild world to navigate when trying to get a job and build your personal brand.
      p We share our personal experiences as Junior Devs as well as interview industry professionals to answer listeners' and our own questions.
      p At the end of the day, we want to make becoming a Developer just a little bit better.
