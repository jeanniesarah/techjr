## Dylan went from Delivering Pizzas üçï to Delivering talks üîä

[Dylan Israel](https://www.youtube.com/codingtutorials360) became a developer to solve a specific personal problem: **poverty.**

We met Dylan at DevFest Florida and knew that we had to have him come on the show!

Dylan dropped out of college twice, delivered pizzas for a living, and knew that he needed to make a change. So he taught himself to code, started a YouTube channel to help market his skills, and broke into the tech industry as a front-end developer.

In this episode we talk to Dylan about his story, plus his TypeScript recommendations and tips for working on side projects and content creation.
