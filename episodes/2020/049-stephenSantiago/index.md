# What if you finally get your break in the Tech Industry and you don't like your job?

That's the predicament that a lot of junior developers face when they break into the industry. Beggars can't be choosers, right? Stephen Santiago had a job that he wasn't super thrilled about when he first started. Working with older or less popular technology, weird practices, and more can sometimes be a real buzzkill when we're so used to the "latest and greatest" everything as developers. Stephen shares his tips on how to best handle a job that doesn't live up to your expectations.
