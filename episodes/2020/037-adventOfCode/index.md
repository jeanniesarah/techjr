excerpt: Have you heard of Advent of Code? It's one of the most challenging collection of programming puzzles out there. So naturally, Lee got suckered into trying it. To up the ante, he decided to do it in Python, which he is not very good at.

## Solve incredibly hard puzzles using a new language ...what's the worst that could happen?

In December Lee got suckered into doing [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com). If you're not familiar, AoC is a collection of puzzles created every year in December. They're meant to be solved one a day leading up until Christmas.

The puzzles are also _notoriously_ difficult, but Lee didn't find that out until after he started.

Not knowing about the difficulty, Lee decided to challenge himself by using AoC as an opportunity to learn Python.

So how did it go?

Well, it went a little like this gif of [day 15](https://youtu.be/dEGizh5CbBc), where you're meant to code a robot exploring a maze in the dark. There was a lot of stumbling and running into deadends, but Lee got there in the end!
