## Speaking at Tech Conferences seems ... daunting

Especially as a junior developer. Would anyone be interested in what you have to say as a less experienced developer?

The answers may surprise you!

[Karl Hughes](https://twitter.com/KarlLHughes) joins us this week to spill the proverbial beans on conference talks, submitting proposals, and writing abstracts.

Karl is a startup CTO, senior PHP developer, and also the man behind [CFP Land](https://www.cfpland.com/), a newsletter dedicated to informing you on CFP deadlines and details like travel reimbursement policies for various conferences.
