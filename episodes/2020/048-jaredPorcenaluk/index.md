## IoT and DevOps... what?

If you're anything like Lee and Eddie, terms like IoT and DevOps are a little... mystical to you. What do those terms even mean?

IoT or Internet of Things, might not mean anything to you at all, and DevOps may evoke terms like Travis, CircleCI, AWS, etc. 

This week we talk to Jared Porcenaluk about both IoT and DevOps and really try to nail down the definition, importance and technologies involved in both. We also talk electric cars and Adam Sandler.
