## How about some positivity in your news feed?

We've got an uplifting tale for you this week. We talked to [Will Johnson](https://twitter.com/willjohnsonio) this week all about his journey from factory work to [Egghead.io](https://egghead.io) Learner Advocate.

We [spoke to Will](https://techjr.dev/episodes/2019/social-media-secrets-getting-kids-to-code-and-self-learning-with-will-johnson/) in September of 2019 about his journey into the Tech industry while he worked his day job and coded on nights and weekends. Soon after that episode, Will got his first tech job, bought a new home, and ultimately saw all his hard work and dedication pay off.

We talk to Will about his new job, his recent success, and also about his foray into learning Ruby and Ruby on Rails.
