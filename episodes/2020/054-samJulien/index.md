## Authentication is a bit of a rabbit hole üê∞üï≥

[Sam Julien](https://samjulien.com) joins us this week to talk all about how to stay productive while dealing with authentication. It's a common time sink for junior devs and can be especially daunting in the JavaScript realm where there's no laravel/rails framework to handle things like auth. Devs are often left piecing together their own auth solution.

Sam also knows a thing or two about GraphQL, so we dig into what it is and how you can use it!
