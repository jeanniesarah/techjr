# Do you have any tech conferences in your area?

Here in Orlando we've been blessed with a few local web development conferences like [Flashback Conference](https://cfe.dev/events/flashback-conference-2020/) and [DevFest Florida](https://devfestflorida.org/). But how do these events compare to bigger ones like [React Rally](https://www.reactrally.com/) or [VueConf](https://us.vuejs.org/)?

This week Eddie and Lee explore the differences between attending big and small conferences and discuss the benefits and drawbacks to both events.

TL;DR: We love local events! Listen to the episode and let us know about conferences you've attended in your city on Twitter [@techjrpodcast](https://twitter.com/techjrpodcast). We'd love to hear about them.

**Note**: Small local conferences are often a labor of love by dedicated individuals in your community. (Listen to our interview with [Brian Rinaldi](https://techjr.dev/episodes/2020/starting-your-own-conference-online-meetup-and-more-with-developer-advocate-brian-rinaldi) for example). With the recent COVID-19 panic a lot of local events have been postponed or canceled. This is a big financial impact to those events and individuals and they could use your support. Consider reaching out to let them know how much those events mean to you. ❤️
