## COVID hasn't been kind to the job market

Developers have been laid off in droves and are re-entering the job market, plus companies are skiddish about spending money on new talent with profits taking a dive. So what are you supposed to do in a struggling job market as a junior developer?

We asked Recruiter Javier Dutan for advice. We covered some great tips for standing out as a developer in the job search and got a great perspective on how recruiters handle recruiting.

We also talked about Latinx developers and minorities in tech, as well as the central Florida tech industry.
