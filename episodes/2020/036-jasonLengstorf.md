## Jason Lengstorf wanted to be a rockstar

I think he got there, just not literally like he originally envisioned.

Jason is a Gatsby and IBM Alumni, and now he's the Principal Developer Experience Engineer for Netlify.

He also hosts his fantastic livestream show [Learn with Jason](https://learnwithjason.dev) where he learns new technologies on the spot from his guests.

Seems like a successful guy, right?

### But Jason didn't set out to be a developer

He wanted to be a musician. So what happened?

Jason started out with music, trying to make it big by hitting the road with his band mates and playing shows.

Jason made pizza, sold vacuums, and worked a lot of other dead-end jobs to keep himself afloat. Jason also managed his band; he booked gigs, designed posters, and ran promotions. Despite his hard work, his rockstar dreams didn't pan out.

All wasn't lost though.

Those management skills ended up translating incredibly well into running a web agency. That lead to speaking, blogging, and eventually working at IBM.

It's crazy how different everyone's journey is into tech.

This week we get the full story on Jason's origins. Plus we talk about content-creation, the JAMstack, and discuss how to get a job in the tech industry as a new developer.
