## How does one go from CS student to Gatsby team member while still in school? ðŸ¤”

[Kyle Gill](https://kylegill.com/) is a developer for [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org) with an interesting story. He started out learning to code through computer science courses at his college, but then quickly fell out of academia and into reality.

This week we ask Kyle all about his story and how he went from learning Binary and C++, to meeting [Kent C Dodds](https://twitter.com/kentcdodds), and then learning JavaScript and React before accepting a position at Gatsby as a learning team member!
