## Gant Laborde returns to tell us about the latest in Machine Learning

It's been a few months since we last spoke to Gant (You can listen to that episode [here](https://techjr.dev/episodes/2019/machine-learning-with-java-script-gant-laborde-teaches-us-tensorflow-js)). Lee finished Gant's AI/ML courses (read all about his experience [here](https://leewarrick.com/blog/learning-machine-learning/)) earlier this year, and when we heard Gant had a [new course on the way](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/gant/intro-to-facial-machine-learning-in-javascript), we knew we had to have him back!

We talk about Lee's experience with Gant's previous courses, his new course, what's new in Machine Learning, and more!
