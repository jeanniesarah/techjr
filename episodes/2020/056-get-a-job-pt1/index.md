## We're trying something new on the show

We're going to try doing some series/shorter episodes on topics with just Eddie and I. Don't worry, we'll still have interview episodes, just less often.

## Breaking into the Tech Industry

Our first series is going to be on breaking into the tech industry. It's a tough thing to pull off in our opinion.

How do you convince an employer to hire you based off of a few dozen hours on freecodecamp or in a bootcamp?

Before we dive into the actual transition though, this week we want to talk about the job itself.

### Is the tech industry really for you?

Before you go drop money on a bootcamp, let's talk about what our day-to-day is like, the office culture, and all about meetings. So many meetings.

Eddie and I love working in tech, but it's not for everyone, and that's OK! We just think everyone should really think about it and do their research before making big life changes.
