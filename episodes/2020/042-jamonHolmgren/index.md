## Should you use React Native?

[React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) is a tool that lets you write React code to build mobile apps, and avoid having to learn Java or Swift. Seems like a big win right? Yet if you've heard of RN before, you've probably been exposed to the big debate surrounding what tool is best for building mobile apps. Some people love React Native, some hate it.

Infinite Red CTO and React expert [Jamon Holmgren](https://twitter.com/jamonholmgren) thinks using React Native is a no-brainer.

In this episode we dive into what React Native is, how it works, and its pros and cons.
