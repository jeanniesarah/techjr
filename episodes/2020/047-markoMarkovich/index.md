## Code Reviews are _Scary_ ðŸ˜±ðŸ‘»

Code Reviews tend to strike fear into the hearts of junior devs and fill them with dread. If you're unfamiliar, Code Reviews are the approval process which your code goes through to make it into production. Your peers site down and review what you've written to make sure it's up to par with the rest of the code in the project.

If you're a junior developer or new on a team, code reviews can be a stressful process. We've certainly been frustrated by code reviews ourselves (looking at you, variable names).

This week we talk to Marko Markovich,the [Backend Bear](https://backendbear.com), about his experiences from the other side of the table as a senior engineer and team lead. We talk about do's and don'ts of code reviews, as well as their importance for the codebase and education of the engineers working on it.
