Howard Salter was working as a developer in the late 90's and early 00's. He was making good money and had a solid career. But after 9/11, Howard left all that behind to serve his country and fight in Iraq.

Howard served in the Army infantry for 7 years before deciding to hang it up and return to civilian life. He decided to pursue a career in tech again as a programmer.

Howard succeeded and eventually started teaching a coding boot camp, becoming Eddie's instructor!

We talk to Howard this week all about his amazing journey as a soldier, developer, and teacher. He shares his lessons learned about leadership and how to apply them to the tech industry. We also talk about how to survive a code boot camp and market yourself to get hired.
