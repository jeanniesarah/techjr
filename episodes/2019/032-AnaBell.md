Dr. Ana Bell joins us this week to talk about python, beginner coders, and teaching her mom to code.

Ana is a lecturer at MIT and teaches there intro to computer science course. In order to sign up for the course at MIT, you have to take a test to see if you know _too much_ coding, otherwise you test out of the course. So Ana is dealing exclusively with students that don't know how to code.

Ana then took that knowledge and used it to write a [book](https://www.manning.com/books/get-programming?query=ana%20bell) and record a [video](https://www.manning.com/livevideo/get-programming-with-python-in-motion?query=ana) series all about the fundamental concepts of programming!
