We talked to Marisa Morby a few weeks back about product management. Marisa has a design background and we talked to her about how that influenced her approach to being a product manager.

This week we're talking to Irma Mesa about product management. Irma has a development background, so we're going to dig into what she does as a PM and how her programming background applies to her current role.

We also talk about working remotely and contrast it against the traditional office environment.
