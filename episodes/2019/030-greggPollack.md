Orlando superstar [Gregg Pollack](https://twitter.com/greggpollack) joins us this week to talk about his career and how he ended up founding [Envy Labs](https://envylabs.com/), Code School, [StarterStudio](https://www.starterstudio.org/), and [Vue Mastery](https://www.vuemastery.com/).

If you've ever thought about starting a SaaS app or a business as a developer, this is a must-listen! Gregg shares a ton of great tips about customer validation and pivoting to ensure you're successful before you commit to building a product.

We also talk about Vue 3, the upcoming Composition API, how Vue Mastery supports the Vue core team! (25 cents of every dollar they get goes to fund Vue!)

This episode was very educational for us as content-creators and we had a blast talking to Gregg.
